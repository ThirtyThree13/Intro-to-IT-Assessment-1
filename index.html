								<span class="image main"><img src="RASIGS.gif" width="10%" height="10%" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
								<p>My interest in IT started with my dad. When I was little his job was to program water plant specific parts to create user friendly solutions during the early 2000s and to help modernize the way that water plants operated. From this I grew to enjoy computers and computer games which combined with my interests in cars and lego helped me grow to towards IT as the career that I could build and operate things that interested me. I studied a Diploma of IT at Victoria University prior to starting this course and I chose that course so that I could be flexible to join the Australian Army. I enlisted in 2020 and have since posted to the 1st Combat Signals Regiment in Darwin and I chose to study RMIT because of the recommendations of people at my unit and the flexibility that online study provides.</p>
								<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
								<p>My ideal job is my current one. A link to the website is linked below in the references. My current job is as a 661 Information Systems Technician. The role of a 661 can vary depending where in the army you are posted to. The most common posting is to a Combat Signals Regiment which is where you will see the most Sigs as that is a dedicated unit for each of the 3 Army Combat Brigades. This job was appealing to me because of being able to work in the outdoors and IT, having stable employment in different parts of the country so I could explore and see Australia. The army is also very well known for training its personnel and that was what I wanted from an employer early in my career. I have all the required skills, qualifications and experience required for the position which is more based on character than individual skills that one may already have. During the first two years in the army you are taught everything you need to be a Soldier, Sig and SysAdmin on deployed systems. My plan prior to enlisting was to get fit enough to join and study so that I would increase my chance to go into Signals, and my goal of IT work in the army.</p>

						<!-- Personality Profile -->
							<article id="Personality_Profile">
								<h2 class="major">Personality Profile</h2>
								<h3>My Results from the Meyers-Briggs test:</h3>
								<p><b>Personality Type:</b> Architect</p>
								<p><b>Traits:</b> Introverted – 54%, Intuitive – 65%, <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Thinking – 64%, Judging – 64%,<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Turbulent – 53%</p>
								<p><b>Role:</b> Analyst</p>
								<p><b>Strategy:</b> Constant Improvement</p>
								<h3>My result from the Education Planner test:</h3>
								<p>- Auditory: 55%</p>
								<p>- Visual: 35%</p>
								<p>- Tactile: 10%</p>
								<h3>My result from the Buzzfeed LOTR quiz: </h3>
								<p>Aragorn</p>
								<br>
								<p>The results of the tests aren’t surprising to me. I think they are an accurate representation of me and my thought process. I don’t think I’m very Turbulent but I would be lying if I hadn’t been called chaotic more than once when organizing things with multiple moving parts and I definitely agree with the goal of constant improvement and working to be better. I think my education planner test could have been more practical based, but I can see how I do gain knowledge through communication.</p>
								<p>I don’t think these results will influence my behaviour in a team. I’ve been hardwired on how to act and work in a team to achieve the desired outcome. I think these results will impact how I form teams by making me think more about how other people have their own traits and how I would use these to better the team and create a favourable outcome.</p>

						<!-- Project Idea -->
							<article id="Project_Idea">
								<h2 class="major">Project Idea</h2>
								<h3>Overview:</h3>
								<p>My project idea is a calculator that has a history function so that people can calculate and see what they had previously calculated in order to be more efficient when working with numbers. This would have a simple GUI and a bar showing current input, and then another expandable bar that has the previous calculations in it as a reference for the user. The application would be usable in everyday life but having the added history would make it very convenient in certain situations or for different professions such as accountants, builders or engineers.</p>
								<h3>Motivation:</h3>
								<p>The motivation for this project is that I am a forgetful person and sometimes forget what I had previously calculated when doing projects around the house or when calculating things. Having a calculator program that could automatically write down calculations made I think would be beneficial to a variety of users and would increase efficiency and reduce the chance of errors from people misremembering a number or incorrectly calculating what they had previously done. Being able to see the previous calculations made and the results would allow for the user to pick up on any errors that they had made in previous calculations rather than use the incorrect result and creating further errors in their work.</p>
								<h3>Description:</h3>
								<p>The Memory Calculator would be a PC program that would contain a simple layout to make it user friendly and easy to understand comprising of a basic numpad layout for the user to interact with the software and support for direct input from either mouse or keyboard. Above the numpad would be a bar showing the current unexecuted equation or the result of the previously executed equation. On the righthand side of the program would be the history bar showing all the previous calculations and results. The biggest feature would be the history shown by the calculator and the base calculator software. The base calculator software would contain the basic math functions of a calculator add, subtract, divide and multiply. </p>
								<p>The calculator functionality would be basic to be compatible for the history function to work. The calculator would have a memory in the sense that it would save the previous input and calculation to the history tab but would not have the ability to add to the previous output. Eg. 2+2=4 would not be recalculated as 4+2=6. I feel a function like reinputting could create problems in the back end when referencing functions for the history bar.</p>
								<p>The History function would push the old calculations down one line when a new calculation is made with the new answer being displayed until a new input is made and the full problem and answer being displayed in the top line in the history bar with the most recent being at the top and the older problems and answers being displayed below that. For example; the input was 2+2=4 the calculator would display 4 in the current bar and 2+2=4 in the top line of the history. Eventually after a few lines the calculator would dump the previous history as it replaced the top line with new problems and answers pushing them down from most recent to oldest. This function would also be very useful to the end user as they could copy the whole line and paste it into a document or excel sheet to show workings out for how they got their final numbers. </p>
								<p>The GUI would be basic but functional. By minimizing the amount of random text and focusing on the meat of the program it will be presented as a more professional program. This will include having basic outlines for buttons and colours that work well together as the three colour elements will be for text, buttons and current input or history bar.</p>
								<h3>Tools and Technology:</h3>
								<p>I believe that python would be the best language to create the Memory Calculators. It would allow for minimal hardware requirements to be able to run and store the software and would be easier to modify for later additional features to be added. Memory Calculator would also require a keyboard and mouse for user entry and a scree for the display of the GUI. Memory Calculator wouldn’t have an dependent software aside from a copy of Windows as the final product would be a .exe file.</p>
								<h3>Skills Required:</h3>
								<p>The skills required to create Memory Calculator are a basic knowledge of python coding and a rough ability to create a simple styled GUI for the user to interact and understand. It would be very easy to find this skillset especially among recent or current students undertaking tertiary education in IT. Python is often used as the first language that people learn as it is easy to pick up and is very capable in what you can create with it. The hardware would be minimal as it is a basic program and has no CPU or GPU intensive software to create or run.</p>
								<h3>Outcome:</h3>
								<p>If the project is successful then a complete product will have been created. The Memory Calculator would be able to fulfil all the uses of a standard calculator and then be able to retain previous calculations and results for the user to reuse or write down. The impact of this software is that it will give a better alternative to the software that is packaged into Windows for basic maths and allow for a user-friendly solution to be adopted by those with poor memories or people that work with numbers that they need to reuse or otherwise remember.</p>
